# 📊 CAHOOTS Data Science for Social Justice Project

## Overview
This project was completed as part of a **Data Science for Social Justice** course. I worked with **CAHOOTS (Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets)** in Eugene, Oregon to analyze real-world data and address a research question provided by the organization.

CAHOOTS offers mobile crisis intervention services as an alternative to police response for mental health crises, homelessness-related concerns, and other non-violent emergencies. The goal of this project was to use data analysis to support community-centered, evidence-based decision-making.

## Research Question
**Primary Question:**  
> *What populations are CAHOOTS serving, and how do these populations differ between Eugene and Springfield?*

The analysis focuses on identifying meaningful patterns in service usage that could help inform program planning and resource allocation.

---

## Data
- **Source:** Call data provided directly to the class through CAHOOTS and demographic data was obtained through Census Reporter
- **Type:** Emergency call / dispatch data and demographic data 
- **Time Period:** *2023*  
- **Notes:**
  - Call data and demographic data were separate and combined by zipcode. Demographic data represents the zipcode of the call not the caller themselves.

## Methods
This project emphasizes ethical, interpretable analysis aligned with social justice principles. Methods include:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing (Python, pandas)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of temporal and categorical trends
- Group comparisons relevant to the research question


The focus was on clarity, accessibility, and real-world applicability rather than purely technical optimization.
